/*
 * TinyEMU x86 — Retro-Go SD external core.
 *
 * The emulator loop: guest memory, CGA video, PC speaker and input, driven a
 * frame at a time. What it does NOT have yet is the DOS layer (#3), so the
 * guest it runs is a built-in real-mode program rather than a loaded .EXE --
 * see demo_guest[]. That program drives the same paths a real game does
 * (segment loads, REP STOSW into video memory, port writes), so video, audio
 * and input are exercised end to end rather than asserted to work.
 *
 * It also still proves the pieces the architecture rests on:
 *
 *   1. The hand-written Thumb-2 interpreter runs from a GNW_CORE_REGION_ITCM
 *      segment (see dos_core.ld) -- the entire performance thesis.
 *   2. CPU state and the guest page table can live in DTCM, which for a core
 *      means a runtime mem_ctl(GW_MEM_DTC, ...) allocation rather than a
 *      statically-placed section ("AHB/DTCM are firmware dynamic pools, not
 *      load targets" -- gnw_core_meta.h).
 *   3. The benchmark and the opcode suite produce the same numbers here as in
 *      the bare-metal harness, so tier 2 and tier 3 are comparable.
 *
 * Video, input, sound and the DOS layer are deliberately absent.
